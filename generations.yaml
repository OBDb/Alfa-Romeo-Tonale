Named after an Italian mountain pass, the Tonale features distinctive Alfa Romeo styling with the signature 'Scudetto' shield grille, 3+3 LED headlights inspired by the SZ and Brera, and a wraparound taillight design. It's available with various powertrain options including a 1.3L turbocharged four-cylinder plug-in hybrid system producing a combined 275 HP and offering around 30 miles of electric-only range. The interior showcases a driver-focused cockpit with a 10.25-inch touchscreen featuring Alfa Romeo's new infotainment system and a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster. The Tonale emphasizes driving dynamics with a focus on handling and responsiveness unusual in its segment, maintaining Alfa Romeo's sporting heritage while adapting to changing market preferences for crossovers and electrification."
